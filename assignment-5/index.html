      <h3>Song Lyrics</h3>
      <p>
        Crashing, hit a wall
        Right now I need a miracle
        Hurry up now, I need a miracle
        Stranded, reaching out
        I call your name but you're not around
        I say your name but you're not around
      </p>
      <p>
        I need you, I need you, I need you right now
        Yeah, I need you right now
        So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
        I think I'm losing my mind now
        It's in my head, darling I hope
        That you'll be here, when I need you the most
        So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
        Don't let me down
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't let me down
        Don't let me down, down, down
        Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
      </p>
      <p>
        Running out of time
        I really thought you were on my side
        But now there's nobody by my side
      </p>
      <p>
        I need you, I need you, I need you right now
        Yeah, I need you right now
        So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
        I think I'm losing my mind now
        It's in my head, darling I hope
        That you'll be here, when I need you the most
        So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
        Don't let me down
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't let me down
        Don't let me down, down, down
        Don't let me down, down, down
        Don't let me down, down, down
        Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah, yeah
      </p>
      <p>
        I need you, I need you, I need you right now
        Yeah, I need you right now
        So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
        I think I'm losing my mind now
